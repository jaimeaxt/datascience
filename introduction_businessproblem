Introduction / Business Problem

Every business that are successful selling their products in physical stores, at some moment, face this question: where can I
open my next store? what neighborhood I have to choose? Many times the stakeholders, make decisions based on their experience or
their intuition, and that is not a problem when the resources are unlimited, but the resources always are limited so, choosing
a bad location could produces a financial disaster.

In this project, lets will analyze a group of gasoline stations in order identifying clusters of neighborhoods, so I could be 
able to identify what kind of neigborhoods represent the majors revenues to the company. Then, when the company make decision
to open a new store, they will know what kind of neihborhood have to search and choose.
